          <div class="text">In the concepts section we touched on the idea of how the resistance of a circuit element is related to
          the potential difference across it for a given current. We can now define that equation explicitly. Ohm’s law states
          that the resistance of a circuit element is equal to the potential difference across the element divided by the current
          through the element. Ohm’s Law is more often written in the form \(V=IR\). The unit of resistance is the ohm,
          which has the symbol of capital Omega (\(\Omega\)). One Ohm is one Volt per Amp.</div>

            <p>We have the same circuit again. This time we have marked points A and B to be references. Note the curly E (\(\mathscr{E}\)) next to
            the battery. That curly E stands for electromotive force or \(EMF\). It is just the potential difference or voltage of
            the battery. \(EMF\) is an old designation, but it means basically the same thing as voltage. I will be writing \(EMF\) as
            \(V_{bat}\) or \(V_{battery}\)</p>
            <p>Conservation of energy tells us that if we look at the electric potential around the circuit, once we have completed
            a loop, we must be at the potential we started at. In other words, the potential difference around a closed loop is
            zero. Let’s start at point B and move clockwise around the circuit. Moving clockwise we come to the low potential
            side of the battery first and step up to the higher potential side. That is an increase in potential. In other words,
            the potential difference across the battery, when going clockwise, is positive. When going across the resistor we are
            dropping in potential. Then we are back at point B.</p>
